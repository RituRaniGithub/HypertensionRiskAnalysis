Used Power BI for the Analysis, after cleaning a total of 26,799 rows.

## Data Cleaning
1. Deleted the blank rows in the Hypertension Column. Then proceeded to apply Median Imputation to the rest of the columns to maintain data completeness.
2. The Column That had way too many data points were converted into groups to get better insights.
3. The column “Resting Blood Pressure” didn’t mention if it was systolic or diastolic pressure so it was assumed to be systolic pressure.
4. The groups divided were as follows.
5.  Max-Heart Rate Achieved
Less tahn 130, "Normal"
130-160,” Elevated”
More than 160,”High”)
6. 2) Old Peak
Less than 1,” Normal”
1-3,” Elevated”
More than 3, “Abnormal”)
7) Serum cholesterol & Resting BP were grouped according to medical standards.

## Insights
1. Prevalence of Hypertension : In the given analysis of 26,799 rows, 14,782 people were found to have Hypertension. That is about 55% people from the given data had hypertension.
2. Gender and Age-Group : There does not seem to be any effect of gender on Hypertension. As we can see around 51% of males have Hypertension, The same percentage is around 49% for Females.
   By looking at the data we can say that age plays a significant role in the cause of hypertension. The age group of 40-70 are at high Risk.
3. Thalassemia Defects and ST Segment : People having fixed thalassemia defects and downward-sloping ST segments were found to have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to others.
4. Abnormal ST Waves and Fasting Sugar Levels : Out of 8,500 people with abnormal ST waves, only 12% had fasting sugar levels exceeding 120 mg/dl.
   Additionally, individuals with abnormal ST curves were found to have hypertension.
5. High Heart Rate and Old Peak: Out of 8,050 people who experienced high heart rate (>160 bpm) around 6,020 people had Normal old peak (<1).
6. Excercise Induced Angina : Around 86% of people who have hypertension experienced exercise-induced Angina.
   Certainly, people experiencing induced enigma due to exercise are at risk of hypertension.
7. Major Vessels and Chest Pain : People who did not have their major vessels colored by fluoroscopy and experienced atypical angina Chest pain had a higher incidence of hypertension.
8. Serum Cholesterol and Resting Blood Pressure : People(around 3,500) with high serum cholesterol and elevated blood pressure experienced a higher prevalence of hypertension.

## Solutions
1. Launch targeted campaigns to educate the population, especially those in the 40-70 age group, about the risk factors and consequences of hypertension.
   Focus on promoting healthy lifestyle choices such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management to reduce the incidence of hypertension.
2. Implement screening programs to identify individuals with certain thalassemia defects, abnormal ST segments, or high serum cholesterol levels who may be at higher risk for hypertension.
   Offer regular health check-ups and check-ups for early detection of high blood pressure and start timely intervention.
3. Encourage individuals with exercise-induced angina to adopt heart-healthy habits, such as regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and adherence to medication regimens. Provide resources and support for managing angina symptoms and reducing the risk of high blood pressure.
